# Global-Sustainable-Energy-Analysis: Building Interactive PowerBI Dashboard that Assesses the Impact of the Emission of CO2 and Other Energy in Developing Countries from 2000 to 2020.
### Description
This project was initiated to explore the sustainability and equity of energy systems across developing nations by analyzing global data on CO₂ emissions, fuel combustion, electricity access, and economic factors (such as cash flow and affordability). The analysis was focused on countries including India, Guinea, and other emerging economies where energy poverty, environmental impact, and access inequality remain critical challenges.
### Business Introduction
Sustainable Insight Analytics (SIA) is a purpose-driven data analytics startup committed to solving global sustainability challenges through the power of data. Our mission is to empower governments, NGOs, and development agencies with actionable insights that drive equitable energy access, environmental sustainability, and socio-economic resilience in underserved regions.
At SIA, we specialize in transforming raw, complex datasets into strategic intelligence. By focusing on energy equity, climate action, and resource distribution, we bridge the gap between data science and development impact. Our work leverages data to inform smarter decisions around energy policy, carbon emissions, and financial inclusion in developing economies.
Our core capabilities include: 
- Data-driven sustainability research
- Energy access and emissions analysis
- Dashboard and reporting development
- Policy-focused data storytelling
### Business Problem
The organizations' problems include the following:
- Unequal Access to Electricity in Developing Regions
- Overdependence on Fossil Fuels
- Lack of Visibility into Energy Affordability & Cash Flow Challenges
- Inadequate Monitoring of CO₂ Emissions and Environmental Impact
- Policy Blind Spots Around Renewable Energy Deployment
### Aim of This Project
The objectives of this project are:
- To measure the impact of CO₂ emissions from fuel consumption across selected countries.
- To assess electricity availability and distribution in urban vs. rural regions.
- To analyze the relationship between energy affordability and household cash flow.
- To evaluate the adoption of renewable energy and its correlation with emissions and energy equity.
- To identify policy gaps and opportunities for sustainable energy interventions.
