# Global-Sustainable-Energy-Analysis: Building Interactive PowerBI Dashboard that Assesses the Impact of the Emission of CO2 and Other Energy in Developing Countries from 2000 to 2020.
### Description
This project was initiated to explore the sustainability and equity of energy systems across developing nations by analyzing global data on COâ‚‚ emissions, fuel combustion, electricity access, and economic factors (such as cash flow and affordability). The analysis was focused on countries including India, Guinea, and other emerging economies where energy poverty, environmental impact, and access inequality remain critical challenges.
