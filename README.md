### Description
This project was initiated to explore the sustainability and equity of energy systems across developing nations by analyzing global data on CO₂ emissions, fuel combustion, electricity access, and economic factors (such as cash flow and affordability). The analysis was focused on countries including India, Guinea, and other emerging economies where energy poverty, environmental impact, and access inequality remain critical challenges.

### Business Introduction
Sustainable Insight Analytics (SIA) is a purpose-driven data analytics startup committed to solving global sustainability challenges through the power of data. Our mission is to empower governments, NGOs, and development agencies with actionable insights that drive equitable energy access, environmental sustainability, and socio-economic resilience in underserved regions.
At SIA, we specialize in transforming raw, complex datasets into strategic intelligence. By focusing on energy equity, climate action, and resource distribution, we bridge the gap between data science and development impact. Our work leverages data to inform smarter decisions around energy policy, carbon emissions, and financial inclusion in developing economies.
Our core capabilities include: 
- Data-driven sustainability research
- Energy access and emissions analysis
- Dashboard and reporting development
- Policy-focused data storytelling
### Business Problem
The organizations' problems include the following:
- Unequal Access to Electricity in Developing Regions
- Overdependence on Fossil Fuels
- Lack of Visibility into Energy Affordability & Cash Flow Challenges
- Inadequate Monitoring of CO₂ Emissions and Environmental Impact
- Policy Blind Spots Around Renewable Energy Deployment
### Aim of This Project
The objectives of this project are:
- To measure the impact of CO₂ emissions from fuel consumption across selected countries.
- To assess electricity availability and distribution in urban vs. rural regions.
- To analyze the relationship between energy affordability and household cash flow.
- To evaluate the adoption of renewable energy and its correlation with emissions and energy equity.
- To identify policy gaps and opportunities for sustainable energy interventions.
### Processes
Step 1: Data Collection and Import
 Tool Used: Second party data gathered on CO₂ emissions, electricity access, renewable vs. non-renewable sources, and cash flow metrics through web scraping.
 - Imported the dataset.
 - Inspected file structure and data types before proceeding.

Step 2: Data Cleaning and Transformation
 Tool Used: Power Query Editor
 - Removed blank rows and columns.
 - Renamed columns for clarity
 - Changed data types (e.g., string to numeric or date)
 - Replaced errors or missing values with null or averages.
 - Filtered out irrelevant columns or duplicate entries.
 - Created new columns

Step 3: Data Modeling
 Tool Used: PowerBI Data Model
 - Built a logical data model to support analysis
 - Established relationships between tables
 - Created calculated columns and measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

Step 4: Data Visualization
 Tool Used: Visuals Features
 - Developed visuals to uncover insights and trends
 - Used Bar and Column Charts to show: CO₂ emissions by country, Electricity availability comparison
 - Used Line Charts for trend analysis over time.
 - Added Pie or Donut Charts for energy source breakdown (renewable vs. non-renewable).
 - Used Cards and KPIs for high-level metrics

Step 5: Dashboard Creation
 Tool Used: PowerBI Data Visualization Features
 - Combined all visuals into an interactive, clean, and focused dashboard
 - Added titles, tooltips, and legends for clarity.
 - Ensured the dashboard was mobile-friendly and logically navigable.

Step 6: Insights and Storytelling
 Tool Used: Power Point and Word
 - Interpreted the visuals to derive key findings and recommendations.
 - Annotated visuals or used "Text boxes" to summarize insights.
 - Highlighted: Regions with highest emissions and lowest electricity access, Countries with the widest rural-urban energy gap, Opportunities for renewable expansion and climate finance.
### Insights
1 Access to Electricity
 - 14957 people had access to electricity in 2020, and this 
accounted for the highest number of people that benefited 
from the availability of electricity in all the developing 
countries; while 12587 in 2000 accounted for the lowest.
  
2 Financial Flow to Developing countries
 - India had the highest financial flow from 2000 to 2020 which 
accounted for $14b; while French Guinea had less than 
$80,000.
 - India, Pakistan, Libya, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, 
Nigeria, Ethiopia, Turkey, and Mauritius made the top 10 
countries by financial flow.

3 Top 5 Countries by GDP
 - Luxembourg had the highest GDP per capita (2053887) from 
2000 to 2020; while French Guinea had less than 30000.
 - Luxembourg, Bermuda, Norway, Switzerland, and Qatar 
made the top 5 countries by GDP.

4 Top 5 Countries by CO2 Emissions
 - China had the highest value of CO2 emission (153M) from 
2000 to 2020; while French Guinea had less than 200000.
 - China, the United States, India, Japan, and Germany made 
the top 5 countries by CO2 emission.
### Recommendations
 - Consistently and evenly distribute electricity over the 
countries for increase in growth and development.
 - Channel finances to all countries accordingly, most 
appropriately, focusing on undeveloped countries.
 - Increase GDP by investing in infrastructure, fostering 
innovation, promoting trade, investing in human capital and 
encouraging business growth.
 - Shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources like solar 
and wind, improve energy efficiency in buildings, 
transportation and industry and implement carbon pricing 
mechanisms to incentivize emission reductions.
